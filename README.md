# PwC ERP Upgrade Project – SAP HANA Implementation

## Project Overview
A global company asked PwC for help to solve ERP upgrade issues on the SAP platform, focusing on security, internal control, and system smoothness. PwC solved this by using SAP HANA as the database platform.  
I created an interview guide with points to ask the client in order to understand their needs better.

## Task 1: Interview Questions for Client Discovery

1. What are the challenges faced after upgrading the ERP system?  
2. What do you think can be done to further improve the ERP system for better future use?  
3. How do you currently measure KPIs after upgrading the ERP system?  
4. Does the ERP system consolidate all the rules, or are there concerns you’d like to address?  
5. Are there any issues with system performance?

## Task 2: User Story and Gherkin Scenario

A user story usually focuses on three areas:

- As a (who)  
- I want to (what)  
- So that (why)

Acceptance criteria define how you know if the interaction is successful.

**Gherkin** helps add a full scenario to the user story so developers and testers can understand both the outcome and output of user interaction.

**Scenario** — the behavior you want to describe  
**Given** — the beginning state  
**When** — a specific user action  
**Then** — a testable outcome caused by the action  
**And** — continues any of the above

Example:

gherkin
Scenario: Setting a password
Given I am an account admin,
When I enter a password in the password field,
Then I should be warned of the password requirements,
And I should be allowed to make corrections right away,
Then I can create a secure account.

## Task 3: MVP Roadmap for Upgraded ERP System

I developed a comprehensive roadmap outlining the key activities necessary to deliver the MVP of the upgraded ERP system.
This roadmap ensures a structured approach with clear milestones, facilitating smooth project execution and effective measurement of success through KPIs.
This structured plan will help the team stay aligned and deliver a high-quality system that meets business needs.

### Roadmap Steps:
1. Define business goals and assign responsibilities  
2. Gather stakeholder requirements and write user stories 
3. Design MVP features and update technical documentation  
4. Develop and implement new ERP modules  
5. Execute SIT and UAT, identify and fix system bugs  
6. Conduct user training and gather user feedback  
7. Go-live and measure success using KPI dashboards
